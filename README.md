# CS 361 Course Project
## Weather Application

### Sprint 1
### Microservices:
### Backend API, Frontend API, GUI Service, Warning Service, Forecast Service, Search Service

# Current on:
Restructuring GUI - 7-day forecast api is 95% complete, but now I want to rework the GUI to not show so much information at once if the user doesn't want to.
Getting Alert functionality working.
Reworking Network send/receive functionality to be based on ZeroMQ, rather than sockets. Potentially reworking API programs to be microservices, if ZMQ is fast enough that is.
