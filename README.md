# CS 361 Course Project
## Weather Application

### Sprint 1
### Microservices:
### Backend API, Frontend API, GUI Service, Warning Service, Forecast Service, Search Service

# Current on:
GUI API - functionality to update API, as well as message handlers to receive and send data is good
All that's needed is function to take incoming data, unpack it, then use it to call functions to update data.

Working on api_manager now
