## CS 361 Course Project
## Weather Application

### Sprint 1
### Main Program: 
#### GUI Manager (gui_manager.py)
### Microservices:
#### Forecast Service (forecast_service.py) | Frontend Manager (frontend_manager.py)

## Usage:

To use the program, first install all files in requirements.txt.

After dependencies are installed, run each of the following programs:
- main.py

In addition, in order to actually use the Google Places (New) API, you must have a valid API Key.
I do not want to upload it to GitHub in case it's used maliciously, so I have attached it in the assignment submission at the end of the file.

To use the API key, please go into api_interface and paste it in place of GLOBALS.{}_API_KEY

## Requirements:

Please see requirements.txt
