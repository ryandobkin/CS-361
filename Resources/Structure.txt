 Send data to GUI Service
 Receive data from GUI Service
 Handle data retrieval for all frontend services
 - Handle data for Warning Service
 - Handle Data for Forecast Service
 - Handle Data for Search Service
   - This may need an API in itself


GUI Service TODO
Written using eel - HTML/CSS/JS Frontend - https://pypi.org/project/Eel/
Does not process anything - just takes and sends values and controls GUI
Accepts requests from frontend service?
Sends requests to frontend service?

 Writing First:
  Last Edit: 7/11/24
  Made sketch GUI in Figma, ported to HTML, partially adapted and refactored for better integration and utility
  Use gui_index.html and main.css
  Currently factored for 1280x720, might update for fullscreen/browser but for now not worth it
  TODO DONE Some shapes did not transfer over - uv widget, alert warning graphic, wind graphic
    if possible, implement proper icons from whatever site is called ---- https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/

    # To call function from JS, must be outside obj (probably)
  Current Functionality:
    search query
    update location display
    Pretty much everything with 7-day forecast
        update daily wind value
        update daily rain value
        update daily hi/lo values
        update weather condition value
        update weather condition graphic
        update date
        TODO all that's needed is to implement the API to edit the values
            Maybe an initialization pass too -- this but for real lol
    The way to do it is to import file into main.py thread start file,
        then start an eel thread and a run() loop. They both reference the web page.

  Current API Requests:
    update_location(location)
    update_daily_rain_percent(day, percent)
    update_daily_wind(day, direction, speed)
    update_daily_hilo(day, hi, lo)
    update_daily_weather_condition_text(day, condition)
    update_daily_weather_condition_graphic(day, graphic_name)
    update_daily_date(day, date)
    update_alert(visible, header, body, source)

  hourly tags:
    temp_hourly_0
    condition_graphic_hourly_0
    hourly graphic container size = 72x72
    time_hourly_0



  graphics to make : width, height
    - clear/sunny          | 55x55
    - partly cloudy        | 71x60
    - haze                 | 74x55
    - fog                  | 71x61
    - windy                | 63x40
    - cloudy               | 71x44
    - thunderstorm         | 71x65
    - light rain           | 71x65
    - heavy rain           | 71x65
    - drizzle              | 71x58
    - snow                 | 61x66
    - freezing rain / hail | 71x66
    heavy snow
    clear (night)
    partly cloudy (night)
    drizzle (night)

graphics
    HOURLY - should be 55high
    DAILY - should be 55high


coords = (container - graphic)/2
