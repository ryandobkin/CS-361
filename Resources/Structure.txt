 Send data to GUI Service
 Receive data from GUI Service
 Handle data retrieval for all frontend services
 - Handle data for Warning Service
 - Handle Data for Forecast Service
 - Handle Data for Search Service
   - This may need an API in itself


GUI Service TODO
 Written using eel - HTML/CSS/JS Frontend - https://pypi.org/project/Eel/
 Sends Inputs to Frontend API
 Receives Outputs (Text Updates, Widget Change, etc.) from Frontend API

 Writing First:
  Last Edit: 7/10/24
  Made sketch GUI in Figma, ported to HTML, partially adapted and refactored for better integration and utility
  Use gui_index.html and main.css
  Currently factored for 1280x720, might update for fullscreen/browser but for now not worth it
  TODO DONE Some shapes did not transfer over - uv widget, alert warning graphic, wind graphic
    if possible, implement proper icons from whatever site is called ---- https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/

  Current Functionality:
    search query
    update location display
    Pretty much everything with 7-day forecast
        update daily wind value
        update daily rain value
        update daily hi/lo values
        update weather condition value
        update weather condition graphic
        update date
        TODO all that's needed is to implement the API to edit the values
            Maybe an initialization pass too

  Current API Requests:
    update_location(location)
    update_daily_rain_percent(day, percent)
    update_daily_wind(day, direction, speed)
    update_daily_hilo(day, hi, lo)
    update_daily_weather_condition_text(day, condition)
    update_daily_weather_condition_graphic(day, graphic_name)
